# Movies-recommender
Helps you select which films to watch next!

Have a folder of movies and cannot decide which movie to watch next?
This code will make your life easier. 

**How to run this program** 
`python3 main.py`  
Choose the folder which contains movies  
Now open index.html file in the same folder   
  	
For ubuntu users, if you can't find your external hard disk or usb   
you can find @ /media/[username]/[mounted device name]  

If this program can't find some movies, mainly due to movie name is not correct or movie name   
is appended by some random stuffs( BluRay, m1080p , m720p, (E-Subs) ,720p.x264,720p, 1080p, 1080p.x264, x265, x264, 10bit, 6CH, HEVC-PSA,YIFY, WEB-DL,  English, or some common user of torrent from whom you download your files)    
or some movie title is not correct on imdb site like for the movie Amnesiac (2014) but this movie was released in 2015.  

  
Enjoy!
